# What is 'Awesome'?

Hold your breath... hold... hold... hold...

That feeling when you can't hold anymore, you let go and you gasp like it's a
pleasant surprise â€“ that is 'awesome'.

Put your hand over your chest, close your eyes and feel your heart beat.
Really feel it because one day you won't be able to feel it anymore and that is 
'awesome'.

Look at this website, it's something I created with the help of people all over the world,
dead and alive who don't even know me or know that this website exists. That is 'awesome'.

Who you are today is not who you will be tomorrow or were yesterday. You'll be
a person who has blinked more than you, now. You were a person who's never seen
or read the contents of this website. The very meaning of 'awesome'.
